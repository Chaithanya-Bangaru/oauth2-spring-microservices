OAuth2.0 Implementation Mechanism :


Trusted Client working on behalf of Web user gets Web user's consent and thus gets authorized to continue the communication with below servers.


Authorization Server
This will generate tokens and send it to Client

Resource Server
Client uses the token and passes to Resource server to access the protected resource


In few cases, Authorization server and Resource server can lie within the same bigger server.
